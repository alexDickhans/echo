## Tips and Tricks (for VEX Programming)

These aren't necessarily best practices for git, so don't expect these to just work at an internship, but this is what I
use for VEX to make sure my code stays reliable.

* Git/GitHub
  * Commit every time the code works
  * Ensure the main branch is always reliable
      * Create branches for each practice or day
      * Utilize main branch protection to make sure any changes have to go through the process
      * Keep up on git discipline, even though you might be working by yourself, this isn't an excuse to leave your
        branches a mess and not commit properly/commit directly to main
  * Utilize this rich version history to find what has changed
* Video Every Run
